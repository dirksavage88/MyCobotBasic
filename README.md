# Custom Gripper Application
You will need to clone this repo, then open the minibot example in the arduino IDE. Next compile and upload to the MyCobot.

Clone the pymycobot fork that has the custom message definition for the DIY Gripper: https://github.com/dirksavage88/pymycobot

# TODO
* Switch to a PWM servo with position feedback wire, or use DroneCAN servos
* Update MyCobot ROS 2 with the servo position feedback for MoveIt grasp compatibility
